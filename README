This is the HH7150 benchmark for automated reasoning in large theories (ARLT).

There are large 7150 problems in the benchmark in the directory
"problems". They are listed in the file ProblemsInProcessingOrder and
contain altogether 7744 formulas. The problems are created by
first-order export of theorems and definitions from 38 HOL
Light/Flyspeck files, listed in FilesInProcessingOrder. Only theorems
and definitions needed by Flyspeck are exported. SVN version 154 of
HOL Light was used together with version r3006 of Flyspeck. 

3005 of these problems could be proved after various attempts by an
ATP system. These problems, using the premises needed just for the
proofs, are in the directory "proofs".

The benchmarks includes among others the Brouwer fixed-point theorem,
Jordan curve theorem, and Luzin theorem.
